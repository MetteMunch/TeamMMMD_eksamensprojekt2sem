# **CONTRIBUTING**

In order to contribute to this project you must be a member of TeamMMMD.
Due to limited time we mainly divide the different code tasks between us in the team. 
When we merge we have an intention to do this physically together so we can review and explain the code immediately.

Remember GitHub Flow:
1. Update the local main branch
2. Create a local feature branch
3. Make commits to the feature branch
4. Update the local main branch
5. Merge the main branch into the feature branch
6. Push the local feature branch to the remote
7. On GitHub create a pull request and assign a reviewer
8. Reviewer reviews the changes
9. Merge the changes
10. Delete the feature branch
11. When User Stories and Issues are validated and approved by PO, main can be merged to deploy branch (CD)
    
*We have created a rule in Github, so it is not possible by mistake to push directly to main.*

## Agreed Code of Conduct (in brief):
-	Words in Endpoint mappings are divided with a dash (eg. @GetMapping("/show-create-customer"))
-	More to come..
-	More to come..
